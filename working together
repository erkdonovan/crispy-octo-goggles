working together
we have org, and a repo on it
everyone forked it/made a copy of it
and cloned it to our computers
add the orgs git url as a new remote called upstream
then work away!
when your code is in a good spot, make a commit.
push it to your origin (your fork).
make a pull request to the organization so that everyone gets that code
!important - do NOT merge your own pull request. you want someone else to look at the code - now they're aware and it help to prevent merge conflicts
then EVERYONE do a git pull upstream master
